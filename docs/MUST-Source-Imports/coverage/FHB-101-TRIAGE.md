# MUST FHB 101 — S1 read-only triage checkpoint

## Scope and decision

This is an incomplete S1 checkpoint, not `TRIAGE APPROVED`.  It records only questions read from the completed deduplicated source family and does not mint IDs, author content, or choose module placement.  Every proposed new item has placement **TBD**.

## Evidence / reproducibility

The readiness selection is exactly the 115 inventory rows where `module=FHB 101` and category is `05 MCQs`, `06 EOM Exams`, `07 EOY Exams`, or `08 Midterm Exams`; it is 106 unique SHA-256s (nine duplicate rows).  Department split: Anatomy 27, Histology 57, Physiology 31; category split: MCQs 48, EOM 21, EOY 0, Midterm 46.

Run the following read-only ledger to obtain the exact selected path, SHA-256, size, page count, audit error, and current text-layer result for every one of the 115 rows (and thereby the exact remaining-file list below):

```text
node scripts/must/fhb101-triage.mjs --root='/Users/doitrous/Desktop/MUST' --inventory='/Users/doitrous/Documents/CodexGPT/Codex-Synapse continue on Claude/ClaudeSynapse/.codex/library_audit/must/inventory.tsv' --inspected='/Users/doitrous/Documents/CodexGPT/Codex-Synapse continue on Claude/ClaudeSynapse/.codex/library_audit/must/inspected-text.json' --text
```

The run returned 70 substantive-text, 6 sparse-text, and 39 empty-text source rows: Anatomy 22/1/4; Histology 28/3/26; Physiology 20/2/9.  `pdftotext` also reported malformed-flate warnings for `Anatomy/05 MCQs/MCQs - VIP Embryo MCQS ️▪️.pdf` and `Histology/05 MCQs/MCQs - Histo FHB101 Exam Night Questions & Notes.pdf`; sparse/empty extraction is not treated as an unread question or a missing key.

## Completed source subset (three inventory paths, one exact document)

| Inventory paths (all `05 MCQs`) | SHA-256 | pages | Printed questions read | Printed/official keys recovered |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `Year 1/Semester 101/FHB 101/Anatomy/05 MCQs/MCQs - Fhb exam 2026.pdf`; `Year 1/Semester 101/FHB 101/Histology/05 MCQs/MCQs - Fhb exam 2026.pdf`; `Year 1/Semester 101/FHB 101/Physiology/05 MCQs/MCQs - FHB101 Exam 2026.pdf` | `a87b09c5f33157263fb623fcfbc2eeb315f90633fdd1a5a8f9244a67c6313e95` | 14 | 36 | 8 |

The document has 28 MCQs without a printed MCQ key and eight written prompts with printed answers: Anatomy 9/2, Physiology 13/3, Histology 14/3 (questions/keys).  Repeated Anatomy and Physiology pages were collapsed before counting.

## Consolidated S1 table — completed subset only

| Module | Questions triaged | Keys recovered | Distinct concepts tested | Live-hit | Pending-hit | New | Placement for new |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| FHB 101 (2026 duplicate family only) | 36 | 8 | 36 | 12 | 12 | 12 | TBD |

## Tested-concept search ledger

Each row was searched with the manual tool using both phrases shown (`node "Instruction Manual for Content Creation/tools/find-existing.mjs"`): its normal hit classification is deliberately not a proposed identifier.

| Department | Tested concept (search pair) | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Anatomy | amniotic fluid / amniotic volume | live-hit |

## Department hand-off split

Completed subset only: Anatomy 9 concepts (live 5, pending 2, new 2); Physiology 13 (5, 4, 4); Histology 14 (2, 6, 6).  This is a future authoring split, not permission to author or allocate canonical module IDs.

## Remaining sources / blocker

**Remaining file list:** all selected ledger rows except the three paths in the completed family above — 112 inventory paths / 105 further SHA-256s, including 39 empty-text and six sparse-text rows.  The command in Evidence is the authoritative exact, path-and-hash-bearing list and must be re-run against the root/Desktop evidence before a continuation claims any question count; no count for those unread sources is estimated here.

**BLOCKED — S1 cannot be approved:** the remaining 112 selected source paths have not had every printed question read, their official/printed keys have not been recovered, and their concepts have not been searched.  The durable evidence snapshot and literal `TRIAGE APPROVED` gate remain absent.  Next: render-and-read each remaining source family, beginning with the 70 substantive-text rows, then update this table from observed questions only.

## Continuation pass — Anatomy EOM written final, Fall 2025

The asserted starting remaining-hash checksum `91625c5786125418de014342444bb52bacea6d8e235c4b31414b3200fd55a3c8` was reproduced from the sorted, newline-joined (with **no** trailing newline) set of 105 hashes before this pass.  The next bounded source was selected from its 67 substantive-text rows: the highest-ranked unread two-page `06 EOM Exams` paper, ahead of keyed-exam and MCQ sources.  Both pages were rendered and read; the text layer is substantive.

| Department | Category | Source path | SHA-256 | Pages | Printed questions read | Printed answers recovered |
|---|---|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Anatomy | `06 EOM Exams` | `Year 1/Semester 101/FHB 101/Anatomy/06 EOM Exams/EOM - Embryology Written final exam FHB 101 Fall 2025.pdf` | `a569f3a6960887f8852b74db3a73a828f642b4857e68ccad9c81db8a3993fbec` | 2 | 3 | 3 |

| Page | Printed question read | Printed answer recovered (transcribed only) | Assigned tested concept | Manual multi-query result |
|---:|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `Embryologic derivatives of the ectoderm include three parts:` | Surface ectoderm, neural tube, neural crest; the listed derivatives are also printed. | Ectodermal derivatives | `ectoderm derivatives` + `surface ectoderm`: new; matches the already-triaged new concept `surface ectoderm / ectoderm derivatives`. |
| 1–2 | `Derivatives of the intra embryonic mesoderm include …` | Paraxial, intermediate, and lateral plate mesoderm, with their listed derivatives. | Intraembryonic mesoderm subdivisions and derivatives | `intraembryonic mesoderm`: live-hit; `paraxial intermediate lateral plate mesoderm`: no match. |
| 2 | `Derivatives of the Endoderm include …` | Epithelial lining of the gastrointestinal tract; epithelial lining of the respiratory tracts; germ cells. | Endodermal derivatives | `endoderm`: live + pending hits; `gastrointestinal epithelial lining`: no match; classified live-hit and matches the already-triaged live endoderm concept. |

The source contributes three question-to-concept assignments but only one newly distinct ledger concept after cross-source deduplication (intraembryonic mesoderm).  Its search outcomes are live 2 / pending 0 / new 1 at assignment level; no answer was inferred or medically corrected.

## Consolidated S1 table — completed sources only

| Module | Questions triaged | Keys recovered | Distinct concepts tested | Live-hit | Pending-hit | New | Placement for new |

## Remaining sources / blocker — after continuation pass

**Remaining file list:** 111 selected inventory paths / 104 unique SHA-256s.  Their sorted, newline-joined hash set (no trailing newline) checksum is `abae3dd35968a276f9c70c0c96480719e3b8d113c18c4afc5cf63b8366bcab04`.  It contains 66 substantive-text, six sparse-text, and 39 empty-text rows.  The ledger command in Evidence remains the authoritative exact path-and-hash list.

**BLOCKED — S1 cannot be approved:** the remaining 111 selected source paths have not had every printed question read, their official/printed keys have not been recovered, and their concepts have not been searched.  The durable evidence snapshot and literal `TRIAGE APPROVED` gate remain absent.  Next: render-and-read the next unread `06 EOM Exams` source family, then update from observed questions only.

## Continuation pass — final revision MCQs, Fall 2023–2024 answered duplicate family

The asserted starting remaining-hash checksum `abae3dd35968a276f9c70c0c96480719e3b8d113c18c4afc5cf63b8366bcab04` was reproduced from the sorted, newline-joined (with **no** trailing newline) set of 104 hashes before this pass.  The next selected unread substantive EOM family is the exact two-path duplicate below.  All ten pages were rendered and read; grey highlighting identifies every printed answer, so all 48 keys below are transcribed from the page rather than inferred.

| Inventory paths (both `06 EOM Exams`) | SHA-256 | Pages | Printed questions read | Printed keys recovered |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `Year 1/Semester 101/FHB 101/Anatomy/06 EOM Exams/EOM MCQs - FHB revision (Final Fall 2023-2024) - answered (2).pdf`; `Year 1/Semester 101/FHB 101/Physiology/06 EOM Exams/EOM MCQs - FHB revision (Final Fall 2023-2024) - answered (2).pdf` | `349ca7a6f8d6fb2622384456c8ecc03a3b8088c1cd09b8fd58d41af4eaa8b54f` | 10 | 48 | 48 |

Although carried in both departmental inventory folders, this is one exact document and is counted once.  Its printed content is blood/erythropoiesis physiology; no Anatomy-specific item was manufactured from the duplicate path.

The family yields 33 distinct source concepts after within-paper collapse.  Six map to concepts already represented in the completed sources (intrinsic-factor/B12 absorption; polycythaemia; MCV/anaemia classification; erythropoietic response to hypoxia/EPO; B12-dependent maturation; iron-deficiency microcytosis), so it adds 27 cumulative distinct concepts.

## Tested-concept search ledger — Fall 2023–2024 family

Every source-distinct concept was checked with the manual search tool against both its compact distinctive term and a separate synonym/phrase recorded in the table.  `live-hit` and `pending-hit` mean the tool returned a live or unimported record respectively; no identifier is proposed here.

## Consolidated S1 table — completed sources only

| Module | Questions triaged | Keys recovered | Distinct concepts tested | Live-hit | Pending-hit | New | Placement for new |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|

**Observed delta:** +48 questions, +48 printed keys, +33 source-distinct tested concepts / +27 after cross-source deduplication.  The cumulative search buckets reconcile exactly: `19 + 20 + 25 = 64`; no module ID, content record, or placement was created.

## Remaining sources / blocker — after Fall 2023–2024 family

**Remaining file list:** 109 selected inventory paths / 103 unique SHA-256s.  Their sorted, newline-joined hash set (no trailing newline) checksum is `ac1ee45623f6a35a97b87170181f14bf12e50b512c8f6be2c668ab5cca8f7291`.  It contains 64 substantive-text, six sparse-text, and 39 empty-text rows.  The ledger command in Evidence remains the authoritative exact path-and-hash list.

**BLOCKED — S1 cannot be approved:** the remaining 109 selected source paths have not had every printed question read, their official/printed keys have not been recovered, and their concepts have not been searched.  The durable evidence snapshot and literal `TRIAGE APPROVED` gate remain absent.  Next: render-and-read the next unread substantive `06 EOM Exams` source family, then update from observed questions only.

## Continuation pass — General Embryology final-night / Fall final 2025 family

The asserted starting remaining-hash checksum `ac1ee45623f6a35a97b87170181f14bf12e50b512c8f6be2c668ab5cca8f7291` was reproduced from the sorted, newline-joined (with **no** trailing newline) set of 103 hashes before this pass.  The next evidence-ranked unread substantive `06 EOM Exams` source was selected because it is an EOM-family paper with its printed `Model Answers of Embryology FHB` page, including a separately labelled Fall final 2025 key.  All eleven pages were rendered and read; its text layer is substantive.

| Department | Category | Source path | SHA-256 | Pages | Printed questions read | Printed keys recovered |
|---|---|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Anatomy | `06 EOM Exams` | `Year 1/Semester 101/FHB 101/Anatomy/06 EOM Exams/EOM MCQs - General Embryology 101 Final night exams questions.pdf` | `3185bf1cbb970c279afdc5bc0a36f9aef98fc50198a30619e940198105b08d6a` | 11 | 78 | 77 |

The 78 questions comprise 65 numbered `Final M.C.Qs` (the printed series skips 44), five matching prompts, seven Fall final 2025 MCQs, and one Fall final 2025 essay.  The printed key supplies 64 option keys for the 65-numbered MCQs: item 27 is explicitly marked `سؤال غلط` ("wrong question") instead of an answer option.  The five matching keys, seven Fall-final option keys, and the one printed essay answer were transcribed as printed; no answer was inferred or medically corrected.

### Question/key assignment ledger

`M` denotes the five printed matching prompts; `F` denotes Fall final 2025 MCQs; `E` denotes its written prompt.  Every printed question is represented below, while repeated prompts are collapsed only for the assigned tested concept.

### Tested-concept search ledger — General Embryology family

Each source-distinct concept was searched with the manual tool using the two recorded phrases.  `live-hit` takes precedence when either query returns live state; otherwise a pending result is retained.  `Already triaged` means question-to-concept deduplication against an earlier completed FHB source, not a proposed identifier or placement.

The family has 37 source-distinct tested concepts.  Eight reproduce already-triaged FHB concepts (fertilization site, gametogenesis/gamete complement, surface ectoderm, sclerotome, ectopic pregnancy, gastrulation/primitive streak, endodermal derivatives, and placental components), so it adds 29 cumulative distinct concepts.  At source-concept level its result split is live 17 / pending 10 / new 10; the non-duplicated delta is live 13 / pending 8 / new 8.

## Consolidated S1 table — completed sources only

| Module | Questions triaged | Keys recovered | Distinct concepts tested | Live-hit | Pending-hit | New | Placement for new |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| FHB 101 (completed sources: 2026 duplicate family + Anatomy EOM Fall 2025 + Fall 2023–2024 answered duplicate family + General Embryology final-night/Fall final 2025 family) | 165 | 136 | 93 | 32 | 28 | 33 | TBD |

**Observed delta:** +78 questions, +77 printed keys, +37 source-distinct tested concepts / +29 after cross-source deduplication.  The cumulative search buckets reconcile exactly: `32 + 28 + 33 = 93`; no module ID, content record, or placement was created.

## Remaining sources / blocker — after General Embryology family

**Remaining file list:** 108 selected inventory paths / 102 unique SHA-256s.  Their sorted, newline-joined hash set (no trailing newline) checksum is `3084eb6d68a52f0d4954d50f0f5b9c23b0e17dcedcf2da2abb3894254cc7e1ca`.  It contains 63 substantive-text, six sparse-text, and 39 empty-text rows.  The ledger command in Evidence remains the authoritative exact path-and-hash list.

**BLOCKED — S1 cannot be approved:** the remaining 108 selected source paths have not had every printed question read, their official/printed keys have not been recovered, and their concepts have not been searched.  The durable evidence snapshot and literal `TRIAGE APPROVED` gate remain absent.  Next: render-and-read the next unread substantive `06 EOM Exams` source family, then update from observed questions only.
